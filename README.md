** Name : ** Hamna Hasan **

I don't have a pet. But I have an adorable 3 yr old toddler who has pretty much changed my lens of seeing the world. 

I have done my undergraduate in Civil Engineering, and MS in Water Resources Engineering. The favourite classes from those days had been:
1. Engineering Materials
2. Disaster Risk Management
3. Hydroclimatology
